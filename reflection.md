- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

Inheritance greatly streamlines the process of creating similar but distinct "blueprints" for your code, allowing you to create many classes with certain shared characteristics while being free to individually tailor these child classes into their own distinct class.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Note: During this assignment, I referenced a GeeksforGeeks article (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashtable-in-java/)to find out how to iterate through a Hashtable. The code that I referenced is found under the section "Performing Various Operations on Hashtable" at number 4, "Traversal of a HashTable) and is pasted below.

    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> e : ht.entrySet())
                System.out.println(e.getKey() + " "
                                + e.getValue());

I edited this sample to fit my program at line 44 of the Library class, where the article is attributed again.
